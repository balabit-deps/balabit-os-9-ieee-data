ieee-data
---------

The package ieee-data installs the Individual Address Block files and the
Organizationally Unique Identifier files in /usr/share/ieee-data. The script
update-ieee-data (used for updating these files) updates them in /var/lib/ieee-data.
This means that, if you want to refer to a relative newer version of these
files, you have to point to /var/lib/ieee-data.
